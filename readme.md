## Dataset

> This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.
this is the website of the data: https://www.bikeshare.com/data/
Go bike system contain 16 columns and 183411 rows.


## Summary of Findings

> most used category of bikes in gender and user type , whereas males number more than females number in using bike Male= 130500 user, 
Female = 40805 user.
User type, subscriber user is greater than customer user, As we see that most of the bike users are subscribed more than 160000 user
I can conclude that Gender and user type effect in using bike.
the birth year also affect the use, the distribution seemed that skewed to left, when the year of birth older the usage gradually decrease, on the other hand, it stopped in 2001 the most users have a birth year between 1970 to 2000.
the mean duration that users take by bike is about 12 minutes most of the users in go bike take duration from 1 to 20 minutes the maximum duration is 1400 minutes.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> for the presentation, I focused on the columns that affect the usage of bike, and after that show, the relation between important columns, and I made some notes below each plot to focus on important points.
>I made a bar plot to show the distribution of gender and user type, after that I used a histogram to show the distribution of duration and year of birth, after that I used a scatter plot to show the relationship between duration and year of birth, and then I used box plot to show the relationship between duration and user type, at the end I used bars to show the relation between gender and user type
